# AD-Onto

A Java tool for importing ADNI data into the AD-Onto ontology.

It only requires Java 8.

The ontology OWL file is available at [https://github.com/iasi-cnr/AD-Onto/blob/main/src/main/resources/model/modiag_adni_ontology__v06_FT.owl](https://github.com/iasi-cnr/AD-Onto/blob/main/src/main/resources/model/modiag_adni_ontology__v06_FT.owl)

## Data availability

Data used in the preparation of the ontology were obtained from the [Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)](https://adni.loni.usc.edu) database and cannot be publicly provided because of their [data use policy](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/how_to_apply/ADNI_DSP_Policy.pdf).
